# Companies that value Deep Work

A list of companies that endorse Cal Newport's Deep Work approach. This might be handy for people who likes to build stuff without intermitent, cheap, and noisy interruptions.

This is a *work in progress*, contributions are welcome.

## Wait, what is Deep Work?

Cal Newport wrote the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+work&qid=1600695114&sr=8-1) in 2016.

As described on a 2012 post on hist blog: "“Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.” 

Some concepts are easier to understand with their constrast. Shallow work is the opposite idea and is defined as: “Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”
