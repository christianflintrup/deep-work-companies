## Wait, what is Deep Work?

Cal Newport wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+work&qid=1600695114&sr=8-1) about Deep Work in 2016. However, he started to discuss the concept years before on his blog.

In 2012, he defined Deep Work as a: "Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.” 

Some concepts are easier to understand with their contrast. Shallow work is the opposite idea of Deep wok and is defined as: “Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”
