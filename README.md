# Companies that value Deep Work

A list of companies that endorse Cal Newport's Deep Work approach. This might be handy for people who like to build stuff without intermittent, cheap, and noisy interruptions.

This is a *work in progress*, contributions are welcome.

## Wait, what is Deep Work?

Cal Newport wrote this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+work&qid=1600695114&sr=8-1) in 2016. However, he started to discuss the concept years before on his blog.

In 2012, he defined Deep Work as a: "Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.” 

Some concepts are easier to understand with their contrast. Shallow work is the opposite idea and is defined as: “Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”
